        <h2>Aspirin</h2>
        <p>
          Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a nonsteroidal
          anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce pain, fever, and/or
          inflammation, and as an antithrombotic. Specific inflammatory
          conditions which aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease,
          pericarditis, and rheumatic fever.

        <h2>IV Drips</h2>
        <p>
          The intravenous route of administration is commonly used for
          rehydration or to provide nutrients for those who cannot, or will
          not—due to reduced mental states or otherwise—consume food or water by
          mouth. It may also be used to administer medications or other medical
          therapy such as blood products or electrolytes to correct electrolyte
          imbalances.

        <h2>Vitamin Supplements</h2>
        <p>
          A multivitamin is a preparation intended to serve as a dietary
          supplement with vitamins, dietary minerals, and other nutritional
          elements. Such preparations are available in the form of tablets,
          capsules, pastilles, powders, liquids, or injectable formulations.
          Other than injectable formulations, which are only available and
          administered under medical supervision, multivitamins are recognized
          by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (the United Nations' authority on
          food standards) as a category of food.

        <h2>Eye Drops</h2>
        <p>
          Eye drops or eyedrops are liquid drops applied directly to the surface
          of the eye usually in small amounts such as a single drop or a few
          drops. Eye drops usually contain saline to match the salinity of the
          eye. Drops containing only saline and sometimes a lubricant are often
          used as artificial tears to treat dry eyes or simple eye irritation
          such as itching or redness. Eye drops may also contain one or more
          medications to treat a wide variety of eye diseases.
